later can change to react or nodejs

use packages.json to include all the dependencies & keeping track of them

User flow: 
            creates account : [params:{[user_id: unique, verifcation: true],[password: standard protocol, encryption: sha256], [user_name: any]}]
            isMetaMaskPresent() : Y|n 
                                    Y: abstract the data & auto connect to site 
                                    n: ask : metamask ??  dono semi custodial wallet
                                                metamask  -> guide & integrate 
                                                dono      -> generate a partial custodial wallet, if requested transfer all data to their account --> all the assests wil be transfered(account will not be given to them)


Development guidelines: 

    metamask integration: demo data is used for the above metamask integration example
                        whenever doing the full implementation, import ethers-js convert data to hexa form, sign the transaction data & post in the transaction snippet
                        Should recheck all the transaction data 


    import eleptic curve npm package and play around with it:
        use salting to generate a privatekey & public key
        for demo purpose do it here, but deal with the stuff only in the server while in deployement
